To reproduce:

1. Run env_config.sh. 
This compiles the file and sets the main script as executable

2. Run bridged_allping.sh
	This creates two debian docker images bbdemo0 and bbdemo1 and connects them
to a docker bridge. The all-to-all ping binary (allping) takes in an iplist of ips to ping, start time,
and number of containers to be pinged with a small udp ping/pong message in the payload.

The iplist is generated dynamically and then copied into the container. Both the iplist and the 
allping binary are copied into the bbdemo containers and the binary is launched at the specified time.
Each container logs the rtt (in seconds) of its own message  and of other containers. i.e. 2 containers would
produce 2 timestamps each resulting in 4 time stamps across two log files.  This is printed out at the end of the script. 

If a packet drop happens it will show up as negative when printed. It may take up to 4 runs before the drops start
to appear.
